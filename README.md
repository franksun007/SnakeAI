SnakeAI
=======

- This repo is used for self-interest. 
- The final aim of this repo is to create a python program that can perform an AI Snake Game.
- The final aim of the length of the Snake is = Width * Height of the platform.

- This program will be run in Python.
- Probably eventually I will try to publish my version of the program using Socket.io.
